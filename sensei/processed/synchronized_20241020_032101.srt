1
00:00:04,138 --> 00:00:04,138
Might be hard for you to hear in your life,

2
00:00:01,837 --> 00:00:01,837
you will inevitably misspeak.

3
00:00:12,612 --> 00:00:12,612
Trust the wrong person.

4
00:00:17,911 --> 00:00:17,911
Underreact, overreact. Hurt the people

5
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:18,239
who didn't deserve it. Overthink.

6
00:00:30,505 --> 00:00:30,505
Not think at all. Self sabotage.

7
00:00:36,462 --> 00:00:36,462
Create a reality where only your experience exists.

8
00:00:41,179 --> 00:00:41,179
Ruin perfectly good moments for yourself and others.

9
00:00:51,735 --> 00:00:51,735
Deny any wrongdoing not take the steps to make it right.

10
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:53,762
Feel very guilty. Let the guilt eat at you.

11
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:00,230
Hit rock bottom. Finally, address the pain you caused.

12
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:01,649
Try to do better next time. Rinse,

13
00:01:06,419 --> 00:01:06,419
repeat. And I'm not going to lie,

14
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:15,329
these mistakes will cause you to lose things.

15
00:01:30,672 --> 00:01:30,672
I'm trying to tell you that losing things doesn't

16
00:01:33,664 --> 00:01:33,664
just mean losing. A lot of the time.
