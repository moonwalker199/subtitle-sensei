1
00:00:04,138 --> 00:00:04,138
Might be hard for you to hear in your life,

2
00:00:01,837 --> 00:00:01,837
you will inevitably misspeak.

3
00:00:12,612 --> 00:00:12,612
Trust the wrong person.

4
00:00:17,911 --> 00:00:17,911
Underreact, overreact. Hurt the

5
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:18,559
people who didn't deserve it. Overthink.

6
00:00:30,825 --> 00:00:30,825
Not think at all. Self sabotage.

7
00:00:36,782 --> 00:00:36,782
Create a reality where only your experience exists.

8
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:41,499
Ruin perfectly good moments for yourself and others. Deny any

9
00:00:51,383 --> 00:00:51,383
wrongdoing not take the steps to make it right. Feel very guilty.

10
00:00:51,738 --> 00:00:51,738
Let the guilt eat at you. Hit rock bottom.

11
00:00:56,798 --> 00:00:56,798
Finally, address the pain you caused. Try to do better next

12
00:00:56,913 --> 00:00:56,913
time. Rinse, repeat. And I'm not going to lie,

13
00:00:58,059 --> 00:00:58,059
these mistakes will cause you to lose things.

14
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:02,129
I'm trying to tell you that losing things doesn't

15
00:01:13,304 --> 00:01:13,304
just mean losing. A lot of the time. When we lose

16
00:01:12,504 --> 00:01:12,504
things, we gain things too.
