1
00:00:04,138 --> 00:00:04,138
Might be hard for you to hear in your

2
00:00:03,053 --> 00:00:03,053
life, you will inevitably misspeak.

3
00:00:13,828 --> 00:00:13,828
Trust the wrong person.

4
00:00:19,127 --> 00:00:19,127
Underreact, overreact. Hurt the people

5
00:00:19,455 --> 00:00:19,455
who didn't deserve it. Overthink.

6
00:00:31,721 --> 00:00:31,721
Not think at all. Self sabotage.

7
00:00:37,678 --> 00:00:37,678
Create a reality where only your experience exists.

8
00:00:42,395 --> 00:00:42,395
Ruin perfectly good moments for yourself and others. Deny any

9
00:00:52,279 --> 00:00:52,279
wrongdoing not take the steps to make it right. Feel very

10
00:00:53,618 --> 00:00:53,618
guilty. Let the guilt eat at you. Hit rock

11
00:00:59,390 --> 00:00:59,390
bottom. Finally, address the pain you caused. Try to

12
00:01:00,321 --> 00:01:00,321
do better next time. Rinse, repeat.

13
00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:03,979
And I'm not going to lie, these mistakes will

14
00:01:10,633 --> 00:01:10,633
cause you to lose things. I'm trying to tell

15
00:01:25,008 --> 00:01:25,008
you that losing things doesn't just

16
00:01:27,736 --> 00:01:27,736
mean losing. A lot of the time.
